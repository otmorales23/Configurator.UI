A simple web application built using ASP.NET and React that demonstrates the functionality of file uploading and downloading. It utilizes the populer 'react-dropzone' library to provide an easy-to-use interface for users to upload files, and it also allows them to download previously uploaded files. See below for screenshots of the uploaded file list and the file downloading process.
